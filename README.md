#- ðŸ‘‹ Hello digital world !

I'm Dave. I am a bartender / restaurant manager / full-time father turned aspiring software engineer.

Currently, I am working through General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Course where I am learning the ins and outs of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery.

Hopefully, one day this repository will be filled with wonderful work created and to be shared by anyone and everyone.

Until that day comes, stay tuned !
